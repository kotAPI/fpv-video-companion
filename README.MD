# FPV Video Companion

Editing FPV videos is hard with tools because it doesnt make sense to employ heavy tools like After effects, wait for it to load, set up project etc etc. Built a tool that helps me trim parts of videos quickly, split them into different files.




# Usage

1. Create a folder called `source`
2. Create a folder called `destination`
3. Place the video in the source folder
4. Set the variables in `index.js`

```
npm run convert
```


# Todo
1. Add UI layer (preferrably react)
2. Electron wrapper
